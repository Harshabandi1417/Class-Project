 | <br /><br />
 Objective of Rental: To rent a vehicle for a week-long vacation, including local sightseeing and day trips.

 Booking Experience: The booking process was straightforward and user-friendly on the Rent-A-Ride website. I was able to select my vehicle type, rental period, and additional options easily. The confirmation email was prompt and included all necessary details.

 Pick-Up Experience: The pick-up process at the Downtown City Center branch was efficient. The staff were courteous and helpful. The vehicle was ready on time, and the paperwork was completed quickly. The only downside was that there was a slight wait due to a high volume of customers.

 Vehicle Condition: The car was clean and well-maintained. It was a recent model with low mileage, which provided a comfortable and smooth driving experience. The interior was spotless, and the exterior had no noticeable dents or scratches.

 Rental Terms and Pricing: The rental rate was competitive and in line with other providers. The final bill matched the initial quote, with no unexpected fees. I opted for the additional insurance coverage, which provided peace of mind during the trip.

 Customer Service: Customer service was generally good. The staff were friendly and addressed my questions effectively. However, there was a minor issue with the GPS system not functioning properly, but it was resolved quickly after contacting customer support.

 Return Experience: Returning the vehicle was easy and hassle-free. The drop-off location was convenient, and the return process was quick. An inspection was conducted on-site, and the deposit was refunded promptly.
